# Tentative

## Micro/Nano-pass compiler architecture

Very small, specialized iteration steps to avoid subtle interactions and dead-end code decisions.

## Package override system

The package override system will be used to fulfill package APIs, such as sort and fmt, in terms of the JS stdlib.

The transpiler may handle fmt printf-style strings specially.

## Generates reasonably-sized, idiomatic JS

## Source Map support
